## Getting Started

Instructions to create your first mobile Android project

### Install Android Studio

Download **Android Studio** at https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and follow instructions to install

### Create Android Project

Open **Android Studio** and choose **New Project**. Name your application **Android Hello World** and click Next.

On the Target Android Devices screen, check the option **Phone and Tablet** and set the Minimum SDK version to API 14: Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich) and click Next.

For this example, select **Empty Activity** and click Next. For other projects, it may make sense to create a project with an activity already set.

Set your Activity Name do MainActivity and the Layout Name to activity_main. Click finish to create the project.

### Run created project

To run your project on Android Studio as it was generated, click Run > Run ‘app’, or the play icon on the top bar.
